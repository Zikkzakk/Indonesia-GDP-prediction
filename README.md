# Indonesia-GDP-prediction
Hi! in this project i analyze Indonesia GDP for the last 20 years (2002--2021) based on a couple metrics such as total population, level of education, and life expectancy. Next I do a visualization to see how much each matrix affects Indonesia GDP. Lastly, I end with a Indonesia GDP prediction using multiple linear regression algorithm.
